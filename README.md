# README
This code belongs to the paper [Deep neural network predicts parameters of quantum many-body Hamiltonians by learning visualized wave-functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03019). 

The structure of this depository is arranged consistent with the results in the manuscript. The depository contains the code for building the CNN and the summary of the CNN structure. Besides, codes for calculation of groud states come from []().

We use Keras to train the neural network. The version of keras is 2.2.4.
